 * A wall-clock hour and two hundred calls, for any book of any length.

 * The hour was set when a chapter was a plan, a scene, and an extraction. A
 * chapter now also carries a cross-encoder over its plan and its prose, an NLI
 * pass over its claims, and up to two replans when the gate refuses it — and a
 * planning call against a long book's accumulated state is minutes on its own.
 * Four chapters no longer fit in an hour, and the run died at the wall with
 * three of them written.
 *
 * So the budget is what a book of this length costs, not a constant: twenty
 * minutes a chapter, never less than an hour, capped at four so a runaway still
 * stops. Calls scale the same way — a chapter is a plan, a scene package and a
 * tracking pass per scene, a repair where one is needed, and a reconciliation.
