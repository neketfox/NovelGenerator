/**
 * Span repair: the last line, and deliberately the smallest one.
 *
 * When a scene turns out to repeat prose the book already wrote, the expensive
 * answer is to write the scene again. That costs a full writing call, a full
 * tracking call, and — worse — a different scene, whose delta, handoff and tail
 * differ from the one the following scenes were planned against. One repetition
 * becomes a cascade.
 *
 * So nothing is rewritten but the sentences that actually duplicate. The
 * detector hands over exact spans; those spans are mapped to the sentences
 * holding them; only those sentences travel to the model, and only those
 * sentences come back. The result is spliced by exact string replacement, which
 * means a replacement that does not apply cleanly simply does not apply — the
 * scene is never left in a state nobody chose.
 *
 * The rule that makes this safe is in the prompt and enforced by the shape of
 * the call: a replacement carries the same information as the sentence it
 * replaces. Nothing happens that did not happen, so memory is untouched and the
 * repair can run before the scene is ever tracked.
 *
 * Two detectors feed it, and they see different things. Word runs catch a
 * sentence carried over intact and cost nothing. A cross-encoder catches the
 * paragraph retold in fresh words, which no amount of string matching reaches —
 * and it is the same model, at the same fitted threshold, that the pre-write
 * gate already uses on scene plans. It runs only when the local models are
 * switched on; with them off the repair is exactly what it was.
